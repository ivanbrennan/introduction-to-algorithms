## 1.2-1
Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the
application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

A GPS application requires algorithmic content at the application level, as it
will need to find the shortest-path between two points, as well as the fastest
route between two points, which may be different than the shortest-path when
road conditions, traffic and speed limits are accounted for.

## 1.2-2
Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the
same machine. For inputs of size *n*, insertion sort runs in 8*n*² steps, while
merge sort runs in 64*n* lg *n* steps. For which values of *n* does insertion
sort beat merge sort?

insertion < merge

8*n*² < 64*n* lg *n*

*n*² < 8*n* lg *n*

*n* < 8 lg *n*

Try some easy values:
- let *n* = 32
  - 32 < 8 lg 32
  - 32 < 40 ✓
- let *n* = 64
  - 64 < 8 lg 64
  - 64 < 48 ✗
- let *n* = 48
  - 48 < 8 lg 48
  - 48 < 44.7 ✗
- let *n* = 40
  - 40 < 8 lg 40
  - 40 < 42.6 ✓
- let *n* = 44
  - 44 < 8 lg 44
  - 44 < 43.7 ✗
- let *n* = 43
  - 43 < 8 lg 43
  - 43 < 43.4 ✓

Insertion sort beats merge sort for 2 ≤ *n* ≤ 43

## 1.2-3
What is the smallest value of *n* such that an algorithm whose running time is
100*n*² runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2*ⁿ* on the same
machine?

100*n*² < 2*ⁿ*
- let *n* = 8
  - 6400 < 256 ✗
- let *n* = 16
  - 25600 < 65536 ✓
- let *n* = 12
  - 14400 < 4096 ✗
- let *n* = 14
  - 19600 < 16384 ✗
- let *n* = 15
  - 22500 < 32768 ✓

The smallest value of *n* is 15.

# Problems

## 1-1 Comparison of running times
For each function *f(n)* and time *t* in the following table, determine the
largest size *n* of a problem that can be solved in time *t*, assuming that the
algorithm to solve the problem takes *f(n)* microseconds.
