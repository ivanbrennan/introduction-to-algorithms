## 2.1-2
> Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into non-increasing instead of
> non-decreasing order.

```
NON-INCREASTING-INSERTION-SORT(A)
1   for j = 2 to A.length
2       key = A[j]
3       // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1 .. j-1].
4       i = j - 1
5       while i > 0 and A[i] < key
6           A[i+1] = A[i]
7           i = i - 1
8       A[i+1] = key
```

## 2.1-3
> Consider the ***searching problem***:
>
> **Input:** A sequence of *n* numbers *A* = 〈a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ 〉and a value *v*.
>
> **Output:** An index *i* such that *v* = *A*[*i*] or the special value NIL if
> *v* does not appear in *A*.
>
> Write pseudocode for ***linear search***, which scans through the sequence,
> looking for *v*. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct.
> Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.

```
LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)
1   for i = 1 to A.length
2       if A[i] == v
3           return i
4   return NIL
```

***loop invariant***: At the start of each iteration of the **for** loop of
lines 1-3, the subarray *A*[1 .. *i*-1] does not contain *v*.

**Initialization:** On the first iteration, the subarray *A*[1 .. *i*-1] is
empty, and thus does not contain *v*.

**Maintenance:** The *i*-th iteration of the loop compares *A*[*i*] to *v*, and
if they're equal, it returns *i*, terminating the loop. Thus, the start of the
next iteration can only be reached if *A*[*i*] does not equal *v*. Therefore,
the loop invariant is maintained.

**Termination:** If one of the iterations finds an index *i* where *A*[*i*]
equals *v*, it terminates the loop by returning *i*. If none of the iterations
found such an index, the loop terminates when *i* exceeds the length of *A*,
which allows the next line (4) to return NIL. In the former case, the procedure
returns the index of an element that equals *v*, and in the latter, the
procedure returns NIL after finding that *A* does not contain *v*.

## 2.1-4
> Consider the problem of adding two *n*-bit binary integers, stored in two
> *n*-element arrays *A* and *B*. The sum of the two integers should be stored
> in a binary form in an (*n* + 1)-element array *C*. State the problem formally
> and write pseudocode for adding the two integers.

**Input:** Two *n*-bit integers, *a* and *b*, stored in two *n*-element arrays
*A* = 〈*a*₁, *a*₂, ..., *a*ₙ 〉 and *B* = 〈*b*₁, *b*₂, ..., *b*ₙ 〉 where
*e* ∈ *A* ⇒ *e* ∈ {0, 1} and *e* ∈ *B* ⇒ *e* ∈ {0, 1}. Both integers are
stored with the least significant bit in the *n*th array element.

**Output:** *a* + *b*, stored in binary form in an (*n* + 1)-element array *C*,
with the least significant bit in the (*n* + 1)th array element.

```
BINARY_ADD(A, B)
1   C = []
2   carry = 0
3   for i = A.length downto 1
4       a = A[i]
5       b = B[i]
6       sum = a + b + carry
7       C[i+1] = sum mod 2
8       carry = sum div 2
9   C[1] = carry
10  return C
```
