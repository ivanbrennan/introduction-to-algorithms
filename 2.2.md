> What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain?

At the start of each iteration of the **for** loop of lines 1-8, subarray
*A*[1 .. *i*-1] is sorted in non-decreasing order and none of its elements
is greater than the smallest element in subarray *A*[*i* .. *A*.length].

**Initialization:** On the first iteration, subarray *A*[1 .. *i*-1] is empty,
and thus sorted (trivially) and none of its elements is greater than the
smallest element in subarray *A*\[1 .. *A*.length] (again, trivially).

**Maintenance:** The *i*-th iteration of the loop finds the smallest element in
subarray *A*[*i* .. *A*.length] and exchanges it with the element in *A*[*i*].
and as a result, *A*[*i*] is not greater than any element in subarray
*A*[*i*+1 .. *A*.length]. Since *A*[1 .. *i*-1] is sorted in non-decreasing
order and none of its elements is greater than *A*[*i*], we know that
*A*[1 .. *i*] is sorted in non-decreasing order. And since *A*[*i*] now contains
the smallest element we found in the rest of the array, we know that none of the
elements in *A*[1 .. *i*] is greater than the smallest element in
*A*[*i*+1 .. *A*.length]. Therefore, the loop invariant is maintained.

**Termination:** The **for** loop terminates when *i* reaches *A*.length. The
loop invariant tells us that subarray *A*[1 .. *A*.length - 1] is sorted in
non-decreasing order and none of its elements is greater than the smallest
element in subarray *A*[*A*.length .. *A*.length], which contains a single
element, *A*[*A*.length]. Therefore, the entire sequence, *A*[1 .. *A*.length]
is sorted in non-decreasing order.

> Why does it need to run for only the first *n* - 1 elements, rather than for
> all *n* elements?

The loop terminates when *i* reaches *n*, and the loop invariant tells us that
subarray *A*[1 .. *n*-1] is sorted in non-decreasing order and none of its
elements is greater than the smallest element in subarray *A*[*n* .. *n*]. Since
the latter subarray contains just one element, the entire array, from *A*[1] to
*A*[*n*] is sorted in non-decreasing order.

```
SELECTION-SORT(A)                cost    times
1   for i = 1 to A.length - 1    c₁      n
2       key = i                  c₂      n - 1
3       for j = i+1 to A.length  c₃      ½n² + ½n - 1
4           if A[j] < A[key]h    c₄      ½n² + ½n - 2
5               key = j          c₅      (½n² + ½n - 2) * qⱼ
6       tmp = A[i]               c₆      n - 1
7       A[i] = A[key]            c₇      n - 1
8       A[key] = tmp             c₈      n - 1
```

The outer **for** loop will check its loop condition (line 1) *n* times, and run
*n* - 1 iterations regardless of the order the array is initially in. Similarly,
on the *i*th iteration, the inner **for** loop will check its loop condition
(line 3) *n*+1 - *i* times, regardless of the order the array's elements are in.

We can calculate the total number of times the inner loop condition will be
checked as follows:
```
((n+1) - 1) + ((n+1) - 2) + … + ((n+1) - (n-1))
 = ((n+1) + (n+1) + … + (n+1)) - (1 + 2 + … + (n-1))
 = (n-1)(n+1) - (1 + 2 + … + (n-1))
 = (n-1)(n+1) - ½(n-1)n
 = (n-1)((n+1) - ½n)
 = (n-1)(½n + 1)
 = ½n² + ½n - 1
```

The only line that will run a different number of times depending what order the
array's elements are in is line 5, which reassigns *key* each time a new minimum
element is encountered.

In the best-case, when *A* is already sorted, the inner **for** loop will never
find an element smaller than *A*[*i*], so it will never reassign *key*, i.e.
line 5 will never run. Thus, the total running time will be:
```
c₁n + c₂(n - 1) + c₃(½n² + ½n - 1) + c₄(½n² + ½n - 2) + c₆(n - 1) + c₇(n - 1) + c₈(n - 1)
 = (½c₃ + c½₄)n² + (c₁ + c₂ + ½c₃ + ½c₄ + c₆ + c₇ + c₈)n - (c₂ + c₃ + 2c₄ + c₆ + c₇ + c₈)
 = Θ(n²)
```

In the worst-case, when *A* is initially in strictly descending order, the inner
**for** loop will find a new minimum on each iteration, reassigning *key* each
time, i.e. line 5 will run ½n² + ½n - 2 times. Thus, the total running time is:
```
c₁n + c₂(n - 1) + c₃(½n² + ½n - 1) + c₄(½n² + ½n - 2) + c₅(½n² + ½n - 2) + c₆(n - 1) + c₇(n - 1) + c₈(n - 1)
 = (½c₃ + ½c₄ + ½c₅)n² + (c₁ + c₂ + ½c₃ + ½c₄ + ½c₅ + c₆ + c₇ + c₈)n - (c₂ + c₃ + 2c₄ +2c₅ + c₆ + c₇ + c₈)
 = Θ(n²)
```

## 2.2-2

```
(1 + 2 + … + n) / n
 = ½n(n+1)/n
 = ½(n+1)
```

*n*

```
LINEAR-SEARCH(A, v)          cost    average-times    worst-times
1   for i = 1 to A.length    c₁      ½(n + 1)         n + 1
2       if A[i] == v         c₂      ½(n + 1)         n
3           return i         c₃      1                0
4   return NIL               c₄      0                1
```

Average running-time:
```
½c₁(n + 1) + ½c₂(n + 1) + c₃
 = (½c₁ + ½c₂)n + ½c₁ + ½c₂ + c₃
 = Θ(n)
```

Worst-case running-time:
```
c₁(n + 1) + c₂n + c₄
 = (c₁ + c₂)n + c₁ + c₄
 = Θ(n)
```

## 2.2-4
> How can we modify almost any algorithm to have a good best-case running time?

Start by checking whether the best case has been encountered, and if so, return
early.
