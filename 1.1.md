## 1.1-1
> Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that
> requires computing a convex hull.

Sorting: A file browser sorts the files it displays, and generally allows the
user to select sorting criteria, e.g. filename, modification date, size, etc.

Convex hull: The shortest path from point A to point B, with an obstacle in
between, will be along the convex hull containing A, B, and the points the
obstacle is composed of.

> Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a
> real-world setting?

The amount of memory required by an algorithm is another measure of its
efficiency.

## 1.1-3
> Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its
> strengths and limitations.

Linked list:
- Strengths
  - Prepending is simple and efficient. Just construct an element with the
    desired value and a pointer to the first element in the existing list,
    then reference the new element as the head of your list.
  - Appending or inserting elsewhere in the list requires updating link
    pointers within the adjacent links, but it's still pretty straightforward.
- Limitations
  - Each link must store both its value and a pointer to the next link,
    requiring additional space.
  - Accessing an element takes linear time, since you have to traverse the list
    from the first element, advancing one by one until the desired element is
    reached.

## 1.1-4
> How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
> How are they different?

The shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems are similar in that both
attempt to minimize the distance traveled. They're different in that the
shortest-path problem is concerned with just two locations, the initial and
final locations, whereas the traveling-salesman problem is concerned with an
initial location, any number of intermediate locations, and a final location
equal to the initial one. Importantly, they also differ in that there is a
known efficient solution for the shortest-path problem, but there is no known
efficient solution for the traveling salesman-problem (it is NP-complete).

## 1.1-5
> Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do.
> Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is
> good enough.

When sorting, only the "best" solution (one where elements are in non-descending
order) will do. When solving a shortest-path problem, an approximately best
solution is often good enough, and frequently distance is only one of the
considerations being considered.
